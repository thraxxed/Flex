Meme Matcher is a Tinder inspired iOS application which matches users together based on shared interest in internet memes.

## Background and Overview

- Users are presented a view with a single meme which they may approve (swipe right) or disapprove (swipe left).
- Users are "matched" together once a certain threshold of similarity in meme taste has been reached.
